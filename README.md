# A little CRUD site

This is a simple CRUD stite which I am using to learn htmx.

## The Stack

- the frontend is written in [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
- the backend is written in Go with some help from [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) and [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)

## Run the server

In the project dir run: `air` in your terminal of choice
